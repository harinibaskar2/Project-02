# Project-02
In this assignment, you will build an AI bot that plays heads-up Texas Hold’em (2 players:
your bot vs. one opponent) using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to decide whether to
fold or stay in a hand.
The bot’s decision is based on a single rule:
“Does my hand have at least a 50% chance of winning?”
You will use MCTS to simulate possible opponent hands and future community cards to
estimate this probability. This project teaches decision-making under uncertainty—a core
AI concept—by applying MCTS to handle hidden information (the opponent’s cards).
